		<p>Michael Mahemoff</p>
		<p>The web has evolved from a document exchange protocol into a platform for rich internet applications. But there's much more to the web than video, canvas, and a hundred other APIs. There are unique, underlying, principles for both the technology and the evolution of that technology. As the web faces growing challenges such as a proliferation of form factors, sensors, and interaction styles, will these principles help or hinder?</p>

		<p>Paul Kinlan, Google</p>
		<p>The web is like a continent with roads linking everywhere to everywhere.  Apps are like isolated islands in an uncharted sea.  Learn how Web Intents builds bridges between these apps and to the rest of the web.</p>

        <p>Martin Beeby, Microsoft</p>

        <p>With the advent of CSS3 and the ever-greater maturity of HTML5, it’s an exciting time for the Web. The possibilities for creating truly engaging – even addictive – Web and business applications appear limitless. And, with the release of Internet Explorer 9, Microsoft finally came in from the cold after many years in the world wide wilderness.</p>

        <p>As Internet Explorer moves towards full support of standards-based HTML5 and CSS3, this is a great opportunity to hear from Martin Beeby about how these key technologies will be used to build and deliver the applications of tomorrow, engage end-users like never before, and generate even greater loyalty to Web-sites.</p></li>

		<p>Seb Lee-DeLisle, CreativeJS</p>
		<p>After a full day of Chrome, Firefox and Opera bigging themselves up, it's time to put their money where their mouth is. Yeah sure, they can all parse HTML and be all accessible and stuff. But now's the time for the most irrelevant test of all! In code written from scratch, Seb will find out which browser can render the most 3D pixels ever!</p>
