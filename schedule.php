            <p>Alp Toker</p>
            <p>Is browser monoculture really good for the future of the web? Will the uneasy alliance between stakeholders reach fever pitch in 2013? What’s coming after HTML5, and is the dream of an open web once again under threat?</p>
            <p>The WebKit Open Source project is a powerhouse of innovation on web standards and browser technology. Driven by an unlikely collaboration between tech giant rivals and a regiment of rockstar coders, WebKit is becoming the de-facto browser engine for desktop web browsers, mobiles and connected devices.</p>
            <p>In this talk, Alp Toker will lay bare the state of WebKit today and explain why we all need work together now to build a better future for the open web.</p>

        <li><h2><span class="time">11:25</span> State of the Mobile Web [Main Room]</h2>
            <p>Paul Kinlan, Chrome</p>

        <li><h2><span class="time">12:00</span> Business as usual: bringing the world wide web to the whole wide world [Main Room]</h2>
            <p>Andreas Bovens, Opera</p>
            <p>In mid-February, Opera announced it will transition its products from Presto to WebKit. I will talk about what this shift entails, focus on our new browser products and features, and cover what changes for developers and users.</p>

        <li><h2><span class="time">12:35</span> Making your HTML5 efforts worthwhile [Main Room]</h2>
            <p>Chris Heilmann, Mozilla</p>
            <p>When the web was defined as an idea it was based on the principle of independence of hardware, global location, prosperity or ability. This changed drastically when the mobile web came around and we got sucked into a world of software dependent on certain hardware and global location. HTML5 and the mobile web based on open technologies became something that needed conversion to native code to access the new hardware people use. This is against the main principle of the web and means we duplicate efforts all over the place. In this talk Chris Heilmann shows how Mozilla is battling this trend and how brushing up your HTML5 solutions allows you to reach millions of new users forgotten by native technology but nevertheless eager to be online.</p>
