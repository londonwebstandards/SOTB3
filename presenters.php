                        Alp Toker is a British programmer and web browser technologist. In 1994, he developed one of the earliest browsers, and, at age 11 attained an A Level in Computer Science with his work on web rendering technology.</p>

                        <p>Since 2006 Alp has become one of the first team leads on the WebKit project outside of Apple’s own Safari group. His developments on mobile browsing have been incorporated into iPhone, and the porting layer has since formed the underpinning of the Android browser and Google Chrome.</p>

                        <p>Alp believes in the browser as an agent of change, having worked on projects like WebKit for OLPC to give Internet access to children in developing countries. His company Nuanti is instrumental in HTML5 video, CSS3, ACID3 and web accessibility that lets vision-impaired users “see” the web.</p>

                        <p>Alp Toker continues to realise his dream at Nuanti where he’s heading up Boot2WebKit, a new OS for connected TV, game consoles and smart devices built on open web standards.</p>
