<p>Things are hotting up! The <a href="http://browser.londonwebstandards.org">State of the Browser</a> day is taking shape nicely, into what will doubtless prove to be a valuable and interesting day of discussions around the latest developments in the major web browsers. I&#8217;ll be there flying the flag for Opera, and there will also be representatives from our esteemed space-sharers, Mozilla, Google and Microsoft.</p>
<p>In terms of what we&#8217;ll be discussing, there will be some set sessions, but a number of the sessions will be fairly open, giving you <em>the audience</em> the opportunity to shape the day, and have your say. And this is why I&#8217;m blogging &#8211; I&#8217;d like you to give us your ideas ahead of time, or at least bring some ideas along for discussion!</p>
<p>I will be centering the Opera session around <a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/new-form-features-in-html5/">HTML5 forms</a>, looking at what new features they bring to your toolbox, what browser support is currently like, and where things are going. I&#8217;d like your input here, as one bone of contention among HTML5 forms is stylability/customization of validation messages, currently only possible with JavaScript. I&#8217;ll lead a discussion on how this could be handled in other ways.</p>
<p>As for my breakout sessions, I&#8217;m thinking of giving mini tutorial sessions on newer CSS3 features such as object-fit, gradients and multi-col. I also want to get some feedback on <a href="http://www.opera.com/dragonfly/">Opera Dragonfly</a>. But I&#8217;m also happy to run sessions on whatever you want help or a discussion on. We&#8217;ll have a board up at the event where people can suggest topics, others can vote topics up or down, and speakers can choose topics to cover.</p>
