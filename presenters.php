        <p>We are in the early stages of putting together this year's conference. Although we have secured almost all of the browser representatives from last year, we are on the lookout for speakers for our breakout sessions.</p>

        <p>This year, along with our main focus (the new and upcoming features for each browser), we are also trying to:</p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>include minor and new browsers from all over the world</li>
                <li>talk about personalisation of the browser (location, language, cookies, etc.)</li>
                <li>cover browsing off the desktop (Smartphones, Tablets, TVs, Games Consoles)</li>
                <li>Mobile UX</li>
                <li>Mobile/Responsove Design</li>
            </ul>
        <p>If you represent a browser (major or minor) and would like to present a talk, or if you would like to host a breakout session, <a href="mailto:organisers@londonwebstandards.org" title="Get in touch if you would like to present at SOTB3">get in touch</a>.</p>
